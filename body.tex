\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

LSST DM conducted the second operations rehearsal (milestones LDM-503-11 see \citeds{LDM-503}) from July 28$^{th}$ to 30$^{th}$ 2020.
The plan for the rehearsal was outlined in \citeds{LDM-643}, the main principle was to simulate
nominal operations with ComCam calibration data flowing from Chile, being processed (calibrated)
and having some quality assurance performed.  The overall emphasis was to investigate/simulate how
raft-scale data be acquired and processed in preparation for ComCam commissioning activities.
\citeds{LDM-643} details the procedure and personnel involved,
hence in this document we give a brief summary of what  happened in the rehearsal taking that as read.


\section{The rehearsal \#2}

There was a short preliminary meeting on the Monday (July 27$^{th}$ 2020) immediately prior to the
rehearsal start to make sure hardware, software, and personnel are ready.

\subsection{System Configuration During the Rehearsal} \label{sec:setup}

ComCam had been installed at the Base (La Serena) computer room and basic operation using the OCS/Archiver
mode had been enabled.  The hardware installation was a filter-less ComCam (with {\it r}-band hard coded
in headers) and basic functionality to obtain bias, flat, and dark frames.

Data transfer from the Base to the current USDF at NCSA were accomplished but the long-haul networks were not
fully operational.  The raft-scale data were ingested into Butler (gen2) repos on arrival at the USDF
and made available through the {\it \/project\/shared/comCam} space (also visible for the LSP).

Processing was accomplished using the nascent utilities processBias.py, processFlat.py, processDark.py
and ingestCalib.py.

The calibrations frames taken were bias, dark, flat sequences of roughly 10 exposures each on each night.
There exist extraneous exposures within the sets but the main calibration sequences used {\it groupId}'s
(e.g., CALSET\_20200728\_1920) to facilitate their identification.  Due to an upcoming lock down in Chile
(due to COVID-19) the calibration sequences were obtained the evening prior to each "night" of the
rehearsal so that the rehearsal could be completed before the lock down began but also to hedge against
slow transfers (because the long-haul networks were not fully functional).  Processing occurred either
in the evening or morning after (depending on the transfer time) and analysis and QA occurred
shortly thereafter.

\subsubsection{Communications }


A Slack channel \href{https://lsstc.slack.com/messages/CJBSY6FUN}{\#ops-rehearal-2} was created for minor communications.

Daily telecon was held using bluejeans at 10:00PST with the agenda:
\begin{itemize}
\item Observing: Recap of previous night's calibrations.
\item Data transfer summary:  How did data transfer and ingest go.
\item Pipeline Processing Summary: 	How did processing go.  Were there errors, incidents, caveats and reference to logs.
\item Metrics/QA:  What can we say about the data. Summary plots and metrics.  What is missing in our view. What can we add for next night?
\item Status:   Current instrument status.  Discuss current plans, changes, action items.

\end{itemize}
